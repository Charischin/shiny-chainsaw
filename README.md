# 2020
Hacktoberfest 2020 project 
2020 is possibly the worst year so far.
I think we can all agree when we say we would like to dig a hole and bury ourselves in it.  
But look on the bright side! 
We did get a lot of time at home to exercise, to spend time with our families, and even to waste. 
And thankfully, at least some governments and people have played their part in containing the spread of coronavirus. 
At any rate, 2020 is ending soon. Let's just hope things take a turn for the better in 2021!
